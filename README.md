computation12 is for case theta_1 < theta_2, computation is for case theta_2 < theta_1

1. T2 < T1.ipynb is the main code template to show all algebraic computations in this paper
2. fixpoint21.nb is the code to do basic algebraic computation and use of CAD algorithm in this paper.
3. JacobianRank21.nb is used to check the Jacobians' ranks are constant, i.e. their equations define regular manifolds.
